TRIXIE
======

This project was undertaken for the sole purpose of messing around with the python programming language.

Nothing to be taken seriously here. Or I may be implementing some cool machine learning hacks. Who knows? With a language this slow but this easy to type, the opportunities are endless.

SERIOUSLY THO
-------------

In all seriousness now, here I plan to host a variety of Python scripts that I plan on writing for various modules. Containing, but not limited to:

* A plugin for Sublime Text 3.(Which? : pass #TODO)

* Some modules for Willie, once I start using it :smirk:

* A plugin for Picard, the MusicBrainz tagger that I've recently grown to appreciate a lot.

* Some other random stuff, possibly something to do with Flask.

My homeboys :metal: @ Google, seem to be really fond of the language, and I decided it was time to try the mainstream finally.
